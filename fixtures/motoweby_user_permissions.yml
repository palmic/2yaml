# Up to two users by default: a superadmin (we suggest reserving this account for developer use and
# removing it at production launch) and an admin (a member of the admin group). We suggest
# giving the latter account to the client. The permissions dashboard is just plain dangerous,
# so we show only the users and groups dashboards to regular admins

sfGuardUser:
  # Uncomment if you want a superadmin. it's usually not a good idea,
  # and you can use the guard:promote-user task if you need it later

  # Regular user admin can do stuff that actually makes sense for, let's say,
  # your client's lead editor but can't delete permissions and otherwise just
  # plain break the system
